# A2PhI
OpenBUGS code and R functions to implement the Bayesian hierarchical model for leveraging animal data in phase I oncology trials. 

Files contained in this repository can be used to reproduce the numerical results reported in the paper entitled
# H. Zheng., L.V. Hampson., S. Wandel. (2020). A robust Bayesian meta-analytic approach to incorporate animal data into phase I oncology trials. Statistical Methods in Medical Research;29(1):94-110. doi:10.1177/0962280218820040.

The file "ISEX_model_final.txt" is the model specification for the proposed methodology to be implemented through OpenBUGS, while the file  "simPhI_Sc1_Nsp.R" has R functions calling the OpenBUGS model in R through the R2OpenBUGS package.
